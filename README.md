## The basics

The HTML-CSS-JS triade is a non negociable step in the learning path of every web developer. The foundational stone, you could say. And because of it, this first project implements them in the purest way it's possible, without any framework or library.

 
I realize a mockup that provides the general structure and style of the website, but in the process I start to do some enhancements (color adjustments, background music, softer transitions), searching for an armonic behaviour between the subject and their functionality.

I hope you enjoy the results!

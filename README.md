## The basics

The *HTML-CSS-JS* triade is a non negociable step in the learning path of every web developer. The foundational stone, you could say. And because of it, this first project implements them in the purest way it's possible, *without* any framework or library.
 
I realized a **mockup** that provides the general structure and style of the website, but in the process I start to do some enhancements (color adjustments, background music, softer transitions), searching for an armonic behaviour between the topic and their functionality.



## The process

This project starts with the simple idea of a **random phrase generator**, because I really enjoy Philosophy and Literature.
I take the manual mockup to a mockup editor: *Figma*, wich results in the following image:

On the left, the initial model. On the right, its implementation with the referred improvements.

Here the same but with the response section: a modal with a blur effect background.

Later I decided that would be useful for the user that could **copy** the content of the phrases and, even more, that could **add** their favorite ones.
So I implemented a favorites section, which I'll show you along with the **responsive design**:

And finally, for a more enjoyable experience, I also added some beautiful and calm background music.

I recognize that it may not have a high level of contrast, but I have preferred to emphasize a pleasant design experience in this case.



## Local tests

Just clone the repository or download it to your hard drive and run `index.html`.

**I hope you like the result!**
